/**
 * vitest.integration.config.ts — coverage gate for integration-only lib code.
 *
 * `vitest.config.ts`'s coverage pass only ever executes the `unit` project
 * (the pre-commit gate is Docker-free), so any file reachable exclusively
 * through an `*.integration.test.ts` - real Postgres required - is invisible
 * to that gate. `postgres-queue.ts`, `queue-contract.ts` and
 * `queue-fixtures.ts` are that case: they are excluded from
 * `vitest.config.ts`'s coverage `include` (see its own header) rather than
 * counted as 0%-covered there, but excluding them is only honest if they are
 * actually measured somewhere else - this file is that somewhere else.
 *
 * It runs the same integration test files as `vitest.config.ts`'s
 * `integration` project, with `--coverage` scoped to just the files no unit
 * test can reach. Thresholds are chosen to be genuinely met today, not
 * aspirational - see docs/testing.md for the measured numbers and the
 * rationale for stopping short of the 95% `apps/web/lib/**` bar the unit
 * pass enforces: `claim()`'s two error-catch branches (an unexpected
 * database failure mid-transaction, and enqueue() failing) have no organic
 * trigger without mocking the module under test, which CLAUDE.md §2.3
 * forbids ("no mocking what we own").
 * Depends on: vitest/config.
